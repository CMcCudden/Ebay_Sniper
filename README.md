Tired of being outbid in the last few seconds on Ebay Auctions? Try using a sniper! Ebay has no regulation against the 
use of software to give you an edge over other who can click faster than you.

To use this program, you will need to adjust the "itemurl", "maxbid", and "timeleft" variables to tailor it to your 
specific auctions. 

This sniper is not a 100% guarantee that you will win an auction, but it's certainly an edge over someone who may be 
actively monitoring the auction, or someone using a sniper.
